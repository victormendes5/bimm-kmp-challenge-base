## 🖼 Image Loading Strategy

| Platform | Loader                                |
|----------|----------------------------------------|
| Android  | Coil 3 (`rememberAsyncImagePainter`)   |
| iOS      | `painterResource("placeholder.png")`   |

All image loading is handled through a shared `rememberImagePainter(url)` implementation.
